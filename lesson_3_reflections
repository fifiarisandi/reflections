When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to share it with other people or when I want to collaborate with others on certain projects. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I want to make sure that the repo on my local is neat and not mixed up.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks: copy repo within GitHub platform
	Clones: copy repo from GitHub to local or copy repo locally
	Branches: create new branch of repo 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Knowing that no matter the changes we made to it, I still have the "original" version or the version that works well. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I could use platform like Google Drive/Docs, but it has its own settings and rules, which might not suitable for sharing technical things.
