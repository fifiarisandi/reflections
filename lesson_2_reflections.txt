What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates .git file in the working directory. So I can track the commits I make to the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It's different since it's only a temporary place that bridges the working directory and the repository. It can be used to store changes temporarily without changing the file "status"

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By using git diff before making commits.
