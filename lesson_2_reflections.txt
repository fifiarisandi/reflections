What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates .git file in the working directory. So I can track the commits I make to the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It's different since it's only a temporary place that bridges the working directory and the repository. It can be used to store changes temporarily without changing the file "status"

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By using git diff before making commits.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	When I'm experimenting with my code but I'm still not sure whether it will work or not or when I create another version with a different language. It will help a lot as it allows me to keep the original file while I'm creating new ones. And also because it's possible to merge them in when I want it.
